Properties associate values with a particular *class*, *structure*, or *enumeration*.

- *Stored properties* store constant and variable values as part of an instance. (Provided only by *classes* and *structures*.)
- *Computed properties* calculate (rather than store) a value. (Provided by *classes*, *structures*, and *enumerations*.)

Stored and computed properties are usually associated with *instances* of a particular type. However, properties can also be associated with the *type* itself. Such properties are known as *type properties*.

In addition, you can define *property observers* to monitor changes in a propertyâ€™s value, which you can respond to with custom actions. Property observers can be added to stored properties you define yourself, and also to properties that a subclass inherits from its superclass.

You can also use a *property wrapper* to reuse code in the getter and setter of multiple properties.
