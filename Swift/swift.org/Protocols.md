A *protocol* defines a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular task or piece of functionality. The protocol can then be adopted by a *class*, *structure*, or *enumeration* to provide an actual implementation of those requirements. Any type that satisfies the requirements of a protocol is said to *conform* to that protocol.

In addition to specifying requirements that conforming types must implement, you can *extend* a protocol to implement some of these requirements or to implement additional functionality that conforming types can take advantage of.

## Protocol Syntax

You define protocols in a very similar way to *classes*, *structures*, and *enumerations*:

```swift
protocol SomeProtocol {
    // protocol definition goes here
}
```

Custom types state that they adopt a particular protocol by placing the protocol’s name after the type’s name, separated by a *colon*, as part of their definition. Multiple protocols can be listed, and are separated by *commas*:

```swift
struct SomeStructure: FirstProtocol, AnotherProtocol {
    // structure definition goes here
}
```

If a class has a superclass, list the superclass name before any protocols it adopts, followed by a comma:

```swift
class SomeClass: SomeSuperclass, FirstProtocol, AnotherProtocol {
    // class definition goes here
}
```

## Property Requirements

A protocol can require any conforming type to provide an instance property or type property with a particular name and type. The protocol doesn’t specify whether the property should be a *stored property* or a *computed property*, it only specifies the required property *name* and *type*. The protocol also specifies whether each property must be *gettable* or *gettable and settable*.

- If a protocol requires a property to be *gettable and settable*, that property requirement can’t be fulfilled by a constant stored property or a read-only computed property.
- If the protocol only requires a property to be *gettable*, the requirement can be satisfied by any kind of property, *and it’s valid for the property to be also settable if this is useful for your own code*.

Property requirements are always declared as *variable properties*, prefixed with the `var` keyword. Gettable and settable properties are indicated by writing `{ get set }` after their type declaration, and gettable properties are indicated by writing `{ get }`.

```swift
protocol SomeProtocol {
    var mustBeSettable: Int { get set }
    var doesNotNeedToBeSettable: Int { get }
}
```

*Always* prefix *type property* requirements with the `static` keyword when you define them in a protocol. This rule pertains even though type property requirements can be prefixed with the `class` or `static` keyword when implemented by a class:

```swift
protocol AnotherProtocol {
    static var someTypeProperty: Int { get set }
}
```

Here’s an example of a protocol with a single instance property requirement:

```swift
protocol FullyNamed {
    var fullName: String { get }
}
```

Here’s an example of a simple structure that adopts and conforms to the `FullyNamed` protocol:

```swift
struct Person: FullyNamed {
    var fullName: String
}
let john = Person(fullName: "John Appleseed")
// john.fullName is "John Appleseed"
```

Here’s a more complex class, which also adopts and conforms to the `FullyNamed` protocol:

```swift
class Starship: FullyNamed {
    var prefix: String?
    var name: String
    init(name: String, prefix: String? = nil) {
        self.name = name
        self.prefix = prefix
    }
    var fullName: String {
        return (prefix != nil ? prefix! + " " : "") + name
    }
}
var ncc1701 = Starship(name: "Enterprise", prefix: "USS")
// ncc1701.fullName is "USS Enterprise"
```

This class implements the `fullName` property requirement as a *computed read-only property* for a starship. Each `Starship` class instance stores a mandatory `name` and an optional `prefix`. The `fullName` property uses the `prefix` value if it exists, and prepends it to the beginning of `name` to create a full name for the starship.

## Method Requirements

Protocols can require specific *instance methods* and *type methods* to be implemented by conforming types. These methods are written as part of the protocol’s definition in exactly the same way as for normal instance and type methods, but without curly braces or a method body. Variadic parameters are allowed, subject to the same rules as for normal methods. **Default values, however, can’t be specified for method parameters within a protocol’s definition.**

As with *type property* requirements, you always prefix type method requirements with the `static` keyword when they’re defined in a protocol. This is true even though type method requirements are prefixed with the `class` or `static` keyword when implemented by a class:

```swift
protocol SomeProtocol {
    static func someTypeMethod()
}
```

The following example defines a protocol with a single instance method requirement:

```swift
protocol RandomNumberGenerator {
    func random() -> Double
}
```

This protocol, `RandomNumberGenerator`, requires any conforming type to have an instance method called `random`, which returns a `Double` value whenever it’s called. Although it’s not specified as part of the protocol, it’s assumed that this value will be a number from `0.0` up to (but not including) `1.0`.

Here’s an implementation of a class that adopts and conforms to the `RandomNumberGenerator` protocol. This class implements a pseudorandom number generator algorithm known as a *linear congruential generator*:

```swift
class LinearCongruentialGenerator: RandomNumberGenerator {
    var lastRandom = 42.0
    let m = 139968.0
    let a = 3877.0
    let c = 29573.0
    func random() -> Double {
        lastRandom = ((lastRandom * a + c)
            .truncatingRemainder(dividingBy:m))
        return lastRandom / m
    }
}
let generator = LinearCongruentialGenerator()
print("Here's a random number: \(generator.random())")
// Prints "Here's a random number: 0.3746499199817101"
print("And another one: \(generator.random())")
// Prints "And another one: 0.729023776863283"
```
