A *protocol* defines a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular task or piece of functionality. The protocol can then be adopted by a *class*, *structure*, or *enumeration* to provide an actual implementation of those requirements. Any type that satisfies the requirements of a protocol is said to *conform* to that protocol.

In addition to specifying requirements that conforming types must implement, you can *extend* a protocol to implement some of these requirements or to implement additional functionality that conforming types can take advantage of.
