# Inheritance

A class can *inherit* methods, properties, and other characteristics from another class.

Classes in Swift can call and access *methods*, *properties*, and *subscripts* belonging to their superclass and can provide their own *overriding* versions of those methods, properties, and subscripts to refine or modify their behavior.

Classes can also add *property observers* to inherited properties in order to be notified when the value of a property changes. *Property observers can be added to any property, regardless of whether it was originally defined as a stored or computed property.*
