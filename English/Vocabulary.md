## 1. What's the difference between document and documentation?

In summary, a "document" is a generic term for any written or recorded record, while "documentation" refers to the process of creating and maintaining materials that explain or provide information about a specific subject or topic.

**Documentation is a type of document created for a particular purpose, such as instruction, reference, or explanation.**

## what's the difference between alongside and along?

In summary, "alongside" implies being next to or in close proximity to something or someone, often with a sense of collaboration. "Along" indicates movement in a linear or continuous direction.

It's important to note that "along" does not inherently imply working together or side by side.
