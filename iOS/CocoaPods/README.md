## Overview

CocoaPods manages library dependencies for your Xcode projects.

The dependencies for your projects are specified in a single text file called a `Podfile`. CocoaPods will resolve dependencies between libraries, fetch the resulting source code, then link it together in an Xcode workspace to build your project.

Ultimately the goal is to improve discoverability of, and engagement in, third party open-source libraries by creating a more *centralised* ecosystem.
